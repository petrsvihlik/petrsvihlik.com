			<title>Referencing Multiple Versions of the Same Assembly in a Single Application</title>
			<link>https://petrsvihlik.com/posts/referencing-multiple-versions-of-the-same-assembly-in-a-single-application</link>
			<description>We've all been there — our application depends on a version of assembly that's incompatible with the version that's referenced by the NuGet package we've just installed.
