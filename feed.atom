		<summary>Building pull requests from forked repositories with GitHub Actions can be a bit tricky when it comes to secrets. As per the documentation, with the exception of GITHUB_TOKEN, secrets are not passed to the runner when a workflow is triggered from a forked repository. This is to prevent the automatic execution of untrusted code that may be contained within the forked repo.</summary>
